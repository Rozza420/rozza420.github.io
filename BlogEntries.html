										<h2>Entry 8</h2>
									</header>
									<p>After finally being able to play Erebos again I put the game in and there I was in the cave where I was the night before in the cave where the messenger left me. Weirdly the messenger knew that I had fulfilled his requests by asking me a weird question, ”what else was written on the box?” After I told him it had my birthdate on it he gave me a new helmet, shield and even a new sword. I then went on to find the white city, although I came across a cave full of scorpions with a thirst for blood. I bought my first scorpion by myself i stupidly took the claws and stinger from the dead beast. After searching around in the dark for a while I found a hidden room where there were other players fighting scorpions. I was about to kill another when another player came over and killed the scorpion. Took my kill. I was given better healing powers by the messenger then I was sent on my way after I found that another player had stolen my wish crystal! I eventually found my way to the white city..</p>

										<h2>Entry 7</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Turns out the locations I was given were real turns out and the task I did wasn’t done in the game but real life out in the world it was so weird but exciting. After that I called Colin not expecting him to answer but he did, I tried to tell him but he told me to keep quiet and not talk about it to anyone or the game would kick me out, he then went on and told me it gets better and how he feels about the game he seems to like it and believes it alive or something I don’t know. Once I finished and got home mum was up and asking about what I did I told her I was at Colin’s and a gave her muffins that I bought for her on the way home that made her happy and she offered me to go the my uncle’s house but I had other plans AKA Erebos once logged back on I gained some new stuff and leveled up to a level 2.</p>

										<h2>Entry 6</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I logged back onto Erebos this morning it was about 1:48 AM and I ended up nowhere near anyone or anything the group wasn’t around and it was a new location so I ventured on and it took a while but I found two new characters around a fire they were a elf and a vampire and  very welcoming they shared some helpful information well as much as they were allowed I guess, then a third character joined a barbarian girl she was muscular and rearing to have a fight but not forcefully she stated that it was boring she just wanted a bit of fun. Suddenly the blue river next to us turned into seven large women shaped forms and tried to drown us I got caught so did the barbarian girl but we both used the fire spell and freed ourselves though most of my life energy was lost that's when the messenger showed up and took me away on his horse to a cave and offered to help me if I help him, I accepted the task and was told that i had to find a box at a church and deliver it to a forest and hide it out of sight from by-passers.</p>

										<h2>Entry 5</h2>
									</header>
									<p>So first of all was lost I think but then I heard a noise so I followed it and found these other characters fighting these huge trolls, there was vampires, elves, dwarves, barbarians etc. this vampire girl was in trouble so I jumped in and ended up getting pretty smashed up but I got a reward from the yellow eyed messenger dude. After that the group allowed me to settle around a fire with them and lets just say some are more friendly than others, you can tell who really wants to win and whos just kinda don’t care much about winning. I am the only level one character in the group so the others aren’t really letting me in on any helpful information, a short time after we had to go and fight some grave robbers and just as I was fighting a robber mum barged in and interrupted my concentration, I raised my voice at her so she slammed the door and stormed off. After that I logged off and went to apologise to mum and guess what packaged spaghetti my favourite…. NOT! Anyway more updates on the game soon I guess. </p>

										<h2>Entry 4</h2>
									</header>
									<p>While playing the game I was starting to get bored but I found this castle thing so I went inside and the yellow eyed guy the ‘messenger’ showed and gave me some new instructions, I had to create a character from scratch it was pretty awesome I had all these choices like a dark elf, a vampire, lizardman, barbarian, dwarves and heaps more. I chose the dark elf because I felt that it suited me best, then the character had to have a role like a thief, knight, salesman and so on I chose the knight because they get to fight more and they have cool swords and stuff. Soon it came to naming my new self and I chose the name Sarius, there he was finished. A dwarf showed up and told me some rules of the game, I get one life only, I can’t tell people who ii am or say anything about the game to outsiders the only time I can speak to another person about the game is when playing. All these strange rule but at least I get to play for reals now. </p>

										<h2>Entry 1</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Well I went to basketball today and Collin ditched me and hasn’t answered his phone, it probably family stuff again, anyway coach was really angry and yelled at the rest of us because some others didn’t show up, he said if this happens again the people who skipped will be punished. When I got home I tried calling again but there was no answer, and the next day at school he was talking to the nerd it was weird tho he wasn’t messing with the nerd he seemed to be the one getting chewed out I walked over and the girl scout gave me some attitude so I told him to get lost seemed to work but Collin was still acting weird and every time I brought it up he would just say nothing and walk off. Then it hit me there was very few people at school and everyone that was was acting weird and passing around these cd’s whatever's on them is a secret though because no one would tell what was on them, at least there was Emily she was always away from the drama she would just draw by herself I really like her she’s nice, anyway hopefully i'll find out what’s going on soon.  </p>
